# # Code example for Toogle Feature presentation
## How to implement custom "toggle"

# Feature Toggle implementation
This example is using simple TODO Web application build in plain JavaScript/HTML with just enough CSS.

Please start with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KodowanieBezCenzury/architecture.git
cd feature-toggle/vanila-web-app
open index.html
```

How to enable/disable feature:
```javascript
//enable
localStorage.getItem('great-feature',true) ↩️
//disable
localStorage.getItem('great-feature',false) ↩️
```

Have fun playing around!
